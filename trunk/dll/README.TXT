WARNING:
As of revision 30, the client DLL (libsvn_client.dll) is built from Subversion 1.4.0 source code.
Using the 1.4.0 client library may automatically upgrade your working copy format which will make your working copy directories unusable by pre-1.4.0 clients!
For more information, see: http://subversion.tigris.org/svn_1.4_releasenotes.html

The Subversion 1.3.2 client DLL is available in a separate repository branch:
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/delphisvn/branches/subversion-1.3.2/dll
